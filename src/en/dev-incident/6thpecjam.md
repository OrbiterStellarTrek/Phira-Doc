# 6thPecJam

This incident occurred around 00:40 on 2024-02-10. The PecJam submission channel was supposed to open at 2024-02-10 00:00 and had already been delayed by over half an hour.

> Note: 2024-02-09 was New Year's Eve; everyone was staying up, waiting to submit to PecJam.

## What happened

With people in the group asking why the PecJam submission channel still wasn't open, sjfhsjfh hastily changed the Phira backend code without even running a build. Mivik had to get out of a warm bed to fix it. Totally inexcusable.
