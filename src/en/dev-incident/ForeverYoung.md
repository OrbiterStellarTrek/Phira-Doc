# Forever Young

This incident occurred at 04:10 on 2024-05-25 (when sjfhsjfh sent in the internal group: “I did something stupid again [animated emoji] want to vanish on the spot”).

## What happened

sjfhsjfh wanted to fix dynamic font distribution (`bold.ttf`) and had Mivik walk them through it to address missing glyphs in some languages. Things went okay until testing: they picked French, opened a **Stable** chart (the victim: [#16576 Forever Young](https://phira.moe/chart/16576)), and when the delete confirmation dialog appeared, sjfh short-circuited. They knew the right move was to download and delete locally, but after downloading they habitually scrolled to the bottom and hit delete online. Faced with the French buttons “Annuler” and “Confirmer,” they correctly guessed which was confirm, but with rationality at zero (it was past Arknights server reset), they clicked confirm in under 0.5 seconds. Hence the chat message above.

Let this be a warning.
