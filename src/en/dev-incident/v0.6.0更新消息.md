# v0.6.0 update message incident

This incident occurred at 23:16 on 2024-01-01 (when Mivik sent in the release discussion group: “Wait what did you do?”).

Similar to the [长风的柳絮](./长风的柳絮.md) incident: manual database changes led to serious consequences. This one is also called “长风的柳絮 2.”

## What happened

sjfhsjfh tried to fix an incorrect announcement that had been posted by mistake. In a rush, they ran an incorrect operation that overwrote **all users’ message content** with the new announcement (the v0.6.0 update notice).

> Mivik spent about a full night recovering; all messages from that day were lost.
