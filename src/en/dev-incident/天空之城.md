# 天空之城 (Castle in the Sky)

This incident occurred at 19:00 on 2024-04-13 (when 大鸽子咕咕咕 sent in the release discussion group: “Anyone who wants some action can take a look; it’s been rejected four times and still in this state, not sure if it’s a bug”).

## What happened

When reviewers rejected a chart under poor network conditions, the chart could end up in a “rejected but not actually sent back” state. That drew 14 reviewers to try to reject the same chart (天空之城) one after another.

Reviewers who participated in the reject attempts:

> 0 approved  
> 14 rejected: 超爱吃盐的盐盐, twotthrees233, 右果ary, WinterPT, scylic, 远空星灵, SSuent_, -zerouth-, StR-1, sjfhsjfh, Max3957, Kedmue, Dr.Asriel, Naptie

……why is sjfhsjfh in there too

In the end Naptie’s “Run Run Run brand private connection” successfully triggered the reject, ending the battle. Or did it? Who knows.
