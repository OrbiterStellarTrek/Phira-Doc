# 长风的柳絮 (Willow catkins in the wind)

This incident occurred at 18:53 on 2023-07-10 (when sjfhsjfh sent in the internal group: “I’m here to kowtow”).

## What happened

sjfhsjfh was manually running SQL to ban the user “长风的柳絮.” They accidentally executed an incomplete UPDATE (no `WHERE` and no `SET banned = TRUE`), which **changed every user’s display name to “长风的柳絮.”**

> Mivik spent the whole afternoon and evening recovering from logs; data loss was limited.

## Afterward

Every cloud has a silver lining: after this, Mivik added a quick ban button for the moderation lead to prevent a repeat. Unfortunately, sjfhsjfh’s jinx streak did not end—see [v0.6.0 update message](./v0.6.0更新消息.md).
