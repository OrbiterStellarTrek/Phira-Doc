# Chart File Formats

Supported chart formats:

- RPE format: see [RPE docs](./rpe/root.md)
- PEC format: see [PE docs](./pe/index.md)
- PBC format (docs TBD)

Format is inferred from the `format` field in `info.yml`; if empty, it is inferred from file content.

::: warning Note
Chart file extension is ignored.
